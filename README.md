# Java Learn

## Motivations 

    * To help others learn the Java programming language. Everyone should learn how to code, if they are willing to. 
    * There are so many devices that use Java.

2. A “functional inventory” for that repository—i.e. what functional components of the overall project are implemented by code in that repository?

## Team

    * Chantelle Rey-Smith - Design, Google SignIn, and Login Screen, Multiple Choice Game, User Functionality
    * Matthew Morgan - Definitions Game, Highlight Game, Fill In the Blank Game, Frontend and Backend Database
    * Leslie Hinds -  Multiple Choice functionality

4. If the code in the repository implements a web service, list the primary endpoints of that service, with a server-relative URL for each. Additionally, if the component is currently hosted and running on an accessible server, include the host name of that server in this section.


5. A description of the current state of completion/readiness of this component, or your project as a whole. This should include a “hit list” of deficiencies: any unimplemented/incomplete elements, and known bugs, that would have to be implemented or corrected for a usable prototype (i.e. one that could be given to a skilled user for testing and feedback), ordered with the most urgent items first.


## Platforms
  
    * Pixel C API 28 (Emulator)
    * Nexus 10 API 26 (Emulator)
    * Java 8, 10, 11
    * Orientation: Landscape
 
## Libraries

    *Spring Boot
    *Google
    *Apache
    *Room
    *Butterknife
    *Retrofit
    *Stetho

## External Services

    * Google SignIn
 
9. For client side components, a list of aesthetic/cosmetic (not functional) improvements that you think would improve this component. This list should be ordered, with those that would give the most improvement (in your opinion) listed first.

10. A list of functional stretch goals. These should be sorted either with those that would add the most utility at the top, or with those that would be the simplest to implement at the top.
