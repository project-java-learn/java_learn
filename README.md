# Java Learn

## Motivations 

Our motivation for this project was to found within our own needs and struggles of learning the Java language. We wanted to create
a tool for Java students to supplement their education. 

### Functional Components

* Google sign in 
* Multiple Choice Game
* Definitions Game
* Highlight Game
* Fill in the Blank Game
* Client-side/backend communication.

## Team

* Chantelle Rey-Smith - Design, Google SignIn, Login & Create Account, Multiple Choice Game, User Functionality and Fragment Management
* Matthew Morgan - Definitions Game, Highlight Game, Fill In the Blank Game, Frontend and Backend Database
* Leslie Hinds -  Multiple Choice functionality

4. If the code in the repository implements a web service, list the primary endpoints of that service, with a server-relative URL for each. Additionally, if the component is currently hosted and running on an accessible server, include the host name of that server in this section.

### Web Service

* 


### Deficiencies

* Credentials will eventually become stale and the app will log you out if you close the app and then come back.

### Stretch Goals

* User points to be calculated and presented to the user
* Let the user choose a picture for their profile
* Add Intermediate and Advanced levels
* Add a glossary 
* Let users add friends and see their profile
