1. Your aims or motivations for selecting the given topic for your project. That is, why did you choose to develop this particular project, and why is this (at least potentially) a useful or interesting project?

    * To help others learn the Java programming language. Everyone should learn how to code, if they are willing to. 
    * There are so many devices that use Java.

2. A “functional inventory” for that repository—i.e. what functional components of the overall project are implemented by code in that repository?

3. A team roster, showing members’ names and primary responsibilities in the project.

    * Chantelle Rey-Smith - XML layouts, Google SignIn, and Login Screen
    * Matthew Morgan - Definitions, Highlight, Fill In the Blank, and Backend
    * Leslie Hinds -  Multiple Choice functionality

### 4. If the code in the repository implements a web service, list the primary endpoints of that service, with a server-relative URL for each. Additionally, if the component is currently hosted and running on an accessible server, include the host name of that server in this section.
```

```
### 5. A description of the current state of completion/readiness of this component, or your project as a whole. This should include a “hit list” of deficiencies: any unimplemented/incomplete elements, and known bugs, that would have to be implemented or corrected for a usable prototype (i.e. one that could be given to a skilled user for testing and feedback), ordered with the most urgent items first.
```

```

### 6. A list of platforms (Java versions, Android APIs, OS versions, specific hardware, etc.) on which you’ve tested the submitted version of this component of your project, any hardware/software/orientation restrictions that you’re aware of. (This includes restrictions on device language, orientation, etc.)
  ```
    * Pixel C API 22 (Emulator)
    * Nexus 10 API 22 (Emulator)
    * Java 8, 10, 11
    * Orientation: Landscape
  ```

### 7. A list of the 3rd-party libraries (i.e. anything beyond the Android standard and support libraries) used by the component.
 ```
    * org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')
    * org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa

    * com.facebook.stetho:stetho:1.5.0
 ```
 
### 8. A list of the external services (including Google services such as Sign In, Calendar, Maps, etc.) consumed by the component.
 ```
    * Google SignIn
 ```
 
### 9. For client side components, a list of aesthetic/cosmetic (not functional) improvements that you think would improve this component. This list should be ordered, with those that would give the most improvement (in your opinion) listed first.
```

```

### 10. A list of functional stretch goals. These should be sorted either with those that would add the most utility at the top, or with those that would be the simplest to implement at the top.
```

```
### 11. Links to the most recent wireframes and up-to-date user stories for your project.
```
    * [JavaLearn Wireframes](JavaLearn_Mockup.pdf)
    * [User Stories](Java_Learn_UserStories.pdf )
```

### 12. Links to the up-to-date ERD and DDL for this component’s data model, unless the component doesn’t have it’s own database.
```
    * [JavaLearnERD](java_learn_erd.pdf)
    * [JavaLearnDDL](java_learn_ddl.pdf)
```

### 13. A link to generated Javadoc HTML pages in your repository (see below).
```
    * [JavaLearn JavadocHTML]()
```

### 14. For components that implement REST-like web services, there should be a link to documentation of those services.
```
    * [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs)
```
